## 💡 Abstract

<details close>
<summary>Detailed Abstract of Symbol-LLM</summary>

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in processing and generating human-like text, they do have limitations when it comes to comprehending and expressing world knowledge that extends beyond the boundaries of natural language(e.g., chemical molecular formula). Injecting a collection of symbolic data directly into the training of LLMs can be problematic, as it disregards the synergies among different symbolic families and overlooks the need for a balanced mixture of natural and symbolic data. In this work, we tackle these challenges from both a data and framework perspective and introduce Symbol-LLM series models. First, we curated a data collection consisting of 34 tasks and incorporating approximately 20 distinct symbolic families, intending to capture the interrelations and foster synergies between symbols. Then, a two-stage tuning framework succeeds in injecting symbolic knowledge without loss of the generality ability. Extensive experiments on both symbol- and NL-centric tasks demonstrate the balanced and superior performances of Symbol-LLM series models.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To try on Symbol-LLM, please use the Transformer library:

```python
# Load model directly
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Symbol-LLM/Symbol-LLM-7B-Instruct")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Symbol-LLM/Symbol-LLM-7B-Instruct")
```


To utilize our symbolic collection, please load the dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# If the dataset is gated/private, make sure you have run huggingface-cli login
dataset = load_dataset("Symbol-LLM/Symbolic_Collection")
```

## 📃 Deployed As A WebUI
The implementation of WebUI is modified from [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). The running script is as follows:

```bash
cd demo-webui/
python server.py --model <model_name> --api --share --gpu-memory 40 40 --compute_dtype float32 --bf16
```


## 📒 Note
This work is still under review. We will open-source the model weights, symbolic collection and the code.
